To prevent rushing, suggest washing hands for as long as it takes to sing the \" Happy Birthday \" song twice. If your child can't reach the sink on his or her own, keep a step stool handy. Be sure to supervise young children using alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Swallowing alcohol-based sanitizers can cause alcohol poisoning. Store the container safely away after use"

Elastic bands or long, straight ties help hold a surgical mask in place while you’re wearing it.  These can either be looped behind your ears or tied behind your head"

desc: "A lockdown is an emergency protocol that usually prevents people or information from leaving an area. The protocol can usually only be initiated by someone in a position of authority. Lockdowns can also be used to protect people inside a facility or, for example, a computing system, from a threat or other external event. Of buildings, a drill lockdown usually means that doors leading outside are locked such that no person may enter or exit. A full lockdown usually means that people must stay where they are and may not enter or exit a building or rooms within said building. If people are in a hallway, they should go to the nearest safe, enclosed room. "

desc: "On Sunday mornings from 25 January 1987 to 31 July 1988 between eighty and one hundred million Indians watched Ramayan, a 78-episode television series directed by Ramanand Sagar (Kumar 2006, 38). This was a realisation of the Ramayana, one of India’s most loved stories, an epic regarded as smrti (“that which is recollected”) scripture, and was shown on Doordarshan (the national broadcaster, founded in 1959). Though derided by critics for its gaudy costumes, extremely slow narrative pace, and low-quality special effects (Lutgendorf 1990, 144-147) Ramayan evoked spontaneous outbursts of popular piety and became an important focus of devotion, with viewers performing purification rituals before the programme began and adorning television sets with flowers and incense, consecrating them as altars (Mitchell 2005, 2).1   Further, Ramayan coincided with a sharp upsurge in Hindu nationalism and religious fundamentalism, which was partially fuelled by the series’ presentation of a Hindu world menaced by demons (the “Other”) (Wu 2008, 12). The presence of a mosque, the Babri Masjid, on the site of the alleged birthplace of Rama (who is an avatar or human manifestation of the god Vishnu) in Ayodhya was a particularly inflammatory issue (Rajagopal 2001, 12). This mosque was demolished by Hindu nationalists on 6 December 1992 (Karner 2005, 213). In the wake of the demolition, “riots across the country … left 2,026 dead and 6,957 wounded” (Rajagopal 2001, 17). Although the destruction of the Babri Masjid took place four years after Ramayan ceased being screened, there is evidence that the serial’s presentation of Rama and Sita as Hindu exemplars of morality and honour, and of Ayodhya as a perfectly-governed kingdom, fuelled anti-Muslim (and anti-non-Hindu generally) feelings and actions.   The stars of Ramayan attempted to carry their popularity from television into politics, with Deepika Chikhalia (who played Sita) being elected in the 1988 by-elections to a Bharatiysa Janata Party (BJP), the Hindu nationalist party, seat. Other members, including Arun Govil (Ram) and Dara Singh (Hanuman) also flirted with politics. The Hindu tradition has always allowed for the presence of gods on earth, through the concept of the avatar, and television simply allowed a larger number of people to focus that belief on the cast of a religious programme. Enormous crowds gathered wherever the stars (particularly the actors who played Ram, Sita and Lakshman) appeared, in order to receive darśan, the “auspicious” seeing of the deities (Eck 1985, 3), and riots and even terrorist bombings were among the more unfortunate side-effects of the Ramayan phenomenon."
